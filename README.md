# Data Visualization Project

This repository includes a personal project of mine that retrieves real-time data of world development indicators from the World Bank, unpacks and analyzes JSON data, and constructs a graphical visualization.

The data is displayed using a combination of Javascript/AJAX, CSS, and HTML SVG's.
